# dotfiles
This is a collection of the configuration files for some of the tools that I use on my personal system.
these have configuration files related to

- **ArchLinux**: my fav distro, always on bleeding edge
- **General Linux & shell command shortcuts**
- **Ruby & Ruby on Rails**: world best web development framework(*Well, I am kinda baised :P*)
- **Git**: the most awesome open-source distributed version control system known to mankind but with a worst possible user interface.
  example `git pull` is exactly equivalent to `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. But then syntax to create new branch is `git branch foo` but this does nothing with it.
  what you really is `git checkout -b foo` creates branch and switches to it -- something which is actually useful.
  <rant>This is so consistent!</rant>. These aliases help improve the UX. you dont need to remember quicky syntax but still get all the power of git.
Feel free to fork and make changes.
