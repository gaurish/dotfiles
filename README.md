This is a collection of the configuration files for some of the tools that I use on my personal system.
these have configuration files related to

- ArchLinux: my fav distro, always on bleeding edge
- General Linux & shell command shortcuts: Linux rocks!
- Ruby & Ruby on Rails: world best web development framework
- Git: the most awesome Distributed version control system known to mankind but with a worst possible user interface.
  example `git pull` is exactly equivalent to `git fetch` followed by “git merge”. But then syntax for “git branch” combined with “git checkout” is “git checkout -b”.
  <scarcasm>Really Consistent!</scarcasm>. These aliases help improve the UX. you dont need to remember quicky syntax but still get all the power of git.
